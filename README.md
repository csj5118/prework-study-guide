# Christopher's Prework Study Guide for students

## Description

The purpose of creating this website was to allow students to have simple and clean U/I to their prework study guide and encapsulating everything we have learned throughout these modules. It contains notes on various topics such as HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. 

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

## Installation

There is no installation needed for accessing the Prework Study Guide

## Usage

Students should first note the header and the cute image of a cat. Then they will notice that it is broken up into 4 sections to get an understanding of the material learned so far.
This website should allow students to get a simple understanding of the topics they learned throughout the Prework Study Guide modules. This website will also allow them to edit and configure notes to their liking. We have also introduced ChromeDevTools ( Control + Shift + I ) to access the console tab for websites which will allow them to see what kind of material we have learned through JavaScript
